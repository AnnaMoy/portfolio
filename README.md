# Anna's Project

## SQL Project
* **Latest Data Science Salaries** -   In this project, I used the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/data-science-salaries-2023?select=v2_Latest_Data_Science_Salaries.csv) to analyze the data to find the salary information for each location. Please feel free to review the [SQL](https://github.com/AnnaMoy/portfolio/blob/main/Query_Datascience_salaries.sql). 


## Tableau Visualization
